                <h2>Hello,I am Mehak Shokeen👋</h2>
            <p>I’m a B.Tech student specializing in 
                Computer Science and Engineering with a 
                focus on Artificial Intelligence. I’ve 
                recently completed my first year and am 
                deeply interested in the world of software 
                development. I enjoy exploring how 
                technology can solve real-world problems 
                and hope to contribute to building 
                meaningful and impactful applications in 
                the future. Alongside my academic interests
                , I have a strong passion for writing—it 
                helps me express ideas creatively and 
                reflect on my experiences. I’m also a movie
                 enthusiast, always on the lookout for 
                 films that inspire, challenge, or simply 
                 entertain. Balancing tech and creativity 
                 is something I truly value as I grow both
                  personally and professionally.</p>

            <dl>
                <dt><b>Schooling🎒</b></dt>
                <dd>I completed my schooling from 
                    Navy Children School, where I was 
                    encouraged to pursue academic 
                    excellence and develop a strong 
                    sense of discipline and curiosity. 
                    My time there laid a solid foundation
                    in science and mathematics, and it was 
                    during these years that I discovered my
                     passion for writing. The supportive 
                     environment and diverse learning 
                     opportunities at NCS played a key 
                     role in shaping my journey toward 
                     pursuing Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.

                <dt><b>College🎓</b></dt>
                <dd>I am currently pursuing my 
                    B.Tech in Computer Science 
                    and Engineering with a 
                    specialization in Artificial 
                    Intelligence at Indira Gandhi 
                    Delhi Technical University for 
                    Women (IGDTUW). Having recently 
                    completed my first year, the 
                    experience has been both challenging
                     and enriching. From learning the 
                     fundamentals of programming and 
                     data structures to exploring the 
                     foundations of AI, this year has 
                     laid a strong academic base for my 
                     future goals. Beyond academics, 
                     I’ve also enjoyed participating in 
                     various events, meeting like-minded
                    peers, and growing both technically 
                    and personally in a dynamic, women-led 
                    environment. </dd>
